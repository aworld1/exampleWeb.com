SPANISH 7-8 Meets the UC/CSU "E" requirement  Grade Level: 10-12  Prerequisite: Grade of C+ or better in Spanish 5-6  PHS: Foreign Language  Spanish  7-8  continues  to  expand  the  creative  ability  to  use  the  language  orally  and  in writing.

Particularly in Spanish 7, new conventions to  be  learned  focus  on  compound  tenses  (e.g. I  have  gone,  I  had  gone,  I  will  have  gone), Conditional and Conditional Perfect (I would go, I would have gone), and new Subjunctive forms  to  include  Present  Perfect,  Imperfect,  and  Past  Perfect.  Readings  will  be  from textbook and outside readings consisting of selected short stories in Spanish. Students are expected to use the language in all classroom activities, including general discussions and discussions  of  readings.  This  class  is NOT for  those  students  uncomfortable  with  the exclusive use of the language.      59  ADVANCED PLACEMENT  SPANISH LANGUAGE 1-2 Meets the UC/CSU "E" requirement  Grade Level: 9-12  Prerequisite: Grade of B or better in Spanish 5-6 Honors or Spanish 7-8  Teacher Recommendation and/or Testing  PHS: Foreign Language  Advanced  Placement  Spanish  Language  refines  the  skills  required  for  advanced  work equivalent  to  a  third  year  college  level  course  and  for  the  AP  Language  examination.
